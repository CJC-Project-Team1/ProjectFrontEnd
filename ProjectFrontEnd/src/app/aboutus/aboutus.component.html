<h1 style="color: brown;text-align: center;">ABOUT US</h1><br>
<p>mPokket is an Instant Loan App that provides loans to college students and young working professionals.</p>
<br>
<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>While still a student in the US, mPokket CEO and Founder Mr. Gaurav Jalan realised that the youth in India were not financially empowered as their counterparts in America. With the goal to provide loans for students and young professionals in India who were not eligible for loans via traditional lending institutions, Gaurav started mPokket, an instant loan app, in 2016.</p>
<p> Users can download and install the instant loan app from the Google Play Store. Borrowers can take instant cash loans anywhere between Rs.500 â€“ Rs.20,000 depending upon their profile and credit history. The money is transferred directly into their bank account.</p>
<p>The repayment plan is flexible with borrowers having the option of paying back the money over a period of 3 months along with a nominal interest charge.</p>
<p>mPokket does not require its users to provide collaterals or physical documents. You can simply upload a handful of documents on the app to register, get approved and start availing an instant personal loan.</p>
<p> We are an RBI registered NBFC.</p>
